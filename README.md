# RightOnTrack-App-Java-
This repository primarily contains work from the FSTM3064 Introduction to Programming Assignment 2, which involved the development of a mobile application by our group. 
The code is somewhat disorganized, as this project was completed during my early stages of learning Java in the foundation course before I was exposed to object-oriented programming concepts.
